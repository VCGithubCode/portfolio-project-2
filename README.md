# The Date, Age, and Birth year Calculator

![Mockup Image](assets/images/dac-mockups.avif)

The Date, Age, and Birth year Calculator is a quick, easy, and straight to the point app, for people that want to know an age, birth year, or difference between two dates.

The Date, Age and Birth year Calculator strives to be a resource for people that have a question about these three choices without the confusion or ruggedness of the current options available on the web.

# User Experience

## Target Audience

- Users looking to recall their own age or figure out the age of someone else quickly using their birth date
- Users looking to recall their own birth year or the birth year of someone else using their age
- Users looking quickly calculate the difference between two dates

## User Stories

### As a first time user I want to:

1. Figure out how to quickly find out my age
2. Calculate my birth year from how many years old I am
3. Find the difference in days between two dates

# Design Choices

The website was designed with simplicity in mind.  There is nothing overwhelming happening to distract the user from their main purpose.  The typical radio buttons have been converted into larger buttons with clearly printed options and a display below that gives the user a second chance to be sure they are asking the right question, making navigating the single page app intuitive.

Clear user feedback is provided immediately and conspicuously so that the user is informed that their input has been received.
