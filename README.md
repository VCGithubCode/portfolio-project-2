# Design Choices

This web app was designed with simplicity as a priority. There are no unnecessary distractions, allowing the user to focus on their main task. The typical radio buttons have been replaced with larger, more prominent buttons that clearly present the available options. Additionally, the display below each selection provides users with a second chance to ensure they are answering the correct question, making navigation through the single-page app intuitive and straightforward.

Users receive immediate and clear feedback to confirm their input has been received.

## Color
![image of color pallet for site](assets/images/dac-palette.avif)

A color palette was chosen that matched the background image representing the natural passage of time.  The idea was that a high level of contrast would make the app more accessible.


## Typography
![Quicksand + Prompt](assets/images/font-pairings.avif)

The typography style that was chosen was meant to be easy to read without being too pensive.  The font size was increased a bit depending on where the messages appeared in the layout for ease on the eyes, but without overpowering the main focus of the app. Some text shadow was added to give the text a style mirroring the hourglass in the background image.  The Google fonts, Quicksand and Prompt, were used based on pairings from [Fontjoy.com](https://fontjoy.com/).

# Features

* ## Calculator Options
![alt text](assets/images/calculator-choices.avif)

The user is presented with three radio buttons that allows them to choose which date calculation they would like to perform by either clicking or using the tab and enter keys.  The typical radio buttons were converted into three selection boxes, allowing the user to more easily select and identify their choice.  The question contained in the selection box also matches the calculator display.
